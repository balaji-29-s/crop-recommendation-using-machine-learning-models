🌾 IoT-Based Crop Recommendation System

This project is a smart **Crop Recommendation System** that utilizes **IoT sensor data** and a machine learning model to suggest the most suitable crop for a given set of soil and weather conditions.

🚀 Project Overview

With the increasing importance of precision agriculture, this project combines **IoT** and **machine learning** to help farmers make data-driven crop choices. 

🧠 How It Works

- IoT Sensors are deployed in the field to capture real-time data, including:
  - 🌧️ Rainfall
  - 🌡️ Temperature
  - 💧 Humidity
  - 🧪 NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels

- This collected data is **uploaded** to the system and fed into a **Crop Recommendation ML model**.

- The model analyzes the values and **predicts the best crop** to grow under those specific conditions.

📂 Files

- `CropRecommendationNotebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the crop recommendation logic using sensor input.

💡 Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Machine Learning (classification models)
- IoT Sensors (Rain, Temp, Humidity, NPK)
- Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib (data analysis and visualization)

📈 Future Enhancements

- Real-time dashboard for farmers
- Integration with mobile app
- Fertilizer recommendation based on sensor data
